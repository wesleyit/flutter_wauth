# WAuth - MFA for Cyborgs

This is a simple Android app created for cyborgs - people who have NFC microchips implanted on their bodies.

Using this app, one will be able to generate one-time passwords for most online services, like Google, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, and many others which allows enabling a virtual MFA app.
